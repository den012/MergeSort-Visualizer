<h1>Merge Sort Visualizer 🚀</h1>

This **Merge Sort Visualizer** is a Java application that allows you to visually understand the Merge Sort algorithm. Merge Sort is a popular sorting algorithm known for its efficiency and stability.

The visualizer provides a graphical representation of the array being sorted at each step of the Merge Sort process. This makes it easier to comprehend how the algorithm divides and conquers the array, ultimately sorting it in ascending order.
